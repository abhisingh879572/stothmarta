          Mediation Even top business leaders have their blindspots. It’s a part
          of being human, but inconvenient or even plain risky for those with a
          lot of responsibility.

              Family Law Mediation is a type of dispute resolution based on the
              cooperation and maintenance of a friendly relationship between
              separating or divorcing partners. This method consists of a
              neutral third party who is present during meetings, and assists
              the parties in coming to an agreement of all issues pertaining to
              the dissolution of their relationship.
            </b>{" "}
            <p>
              Basic steps in the process include gathering information, framing
              the issues, developing options, negotiating, and formalizing
              agreements. Parties in mediation create their own solutions and
              the mediator does not have any decision-making power over the
              outcome. Executive-level leaders face unique challenges; they
              confront a myriad of issues, uncertainties, and demands every
              single day. The decisions and actions of these leaders affect
              shareholders, customers, and employees, so they must work hard to
              satisfy competing demands—a difficult task even under the best of
              circumstances. With everything there is for senior-level leaders
              to do and consider, the need to help them maximize their
              leadership effectiveness is more critical than ever. No matter how
              talented, experienced, or knowledgeable these leaders may be, the
              nature of their work requires that they continue to develop their
              leadership skills so they can perform at peak levels.

          <b>Quicker </b> <br />
          You are likely to reach a solution more quickly through mediation than
          by going to court. Confidential Mediation takes place on a ‘without
          prejudice’ basis; the negotiations cannot be referred to in court or
          relied upon by the other party if the discussions fail.

            Through coaching, you’ll learn to first see yourself as others see
            you, and then explore the factors that can influence their
            perception. Coaching may cover topics like:
          </p>
          <p>
            > How your personal posture, stance, and mannerisms affect your
            brand <br />
            > Social expectations
            <br />
            > Nuances of professional etiquette from board meetings to business
            lunches <br />
            > The psychological drivers that affect actions, choices and
            ultimately, reputation
            <br />
          </p>
          <p>
            Increasing emotional intelligence improves relationships and the
            navigation of complex social situations.
          </p>
          Executive Coaching is the opportunity to accelerate leadership
          development and to objectively treat different complex challenges. If
          you want to invest in yourself or you want to bring your executive
          team to the next level, Executive Coaching it’s the perfect next step.

                you’ve been separated for a while, or if your case has already
                gone to court, mediation can still help to resolve things. You
                can’t usually take your case to court until you find out if
                mediation can help you first. If you can’t show that you’ve
                considered it, the judge may stop or delay proceedings until you
                have.

            What happens on the mediation day
          </h5>
        </p>
        <p className="p-10">
          The mediators bring all the parties and their representatives together
          into one room for a joint initial meeting. This allows everybody to
          introduce themselves. The mediators give a brief overview of the day
          and they ask the parties to sign a Mediation Agreement at that stage.
          The mediators ask each party to give a brief summary of the case and
          the issues as they see them. Each party’s summary should take no
          longer than five minutes. The parties then go to separate rooms. The
          mediators hold a series of separate, confidential and without
          prejudice meetings with the parties, which allow them to examine the
          issues, develop options and find proposals with which the parties can
          agree. Of course, if the parties agree to continue the discussions
          face-to-face, the mediator will continue the meeting with both parties
          trying to find common points. If the mediators can find proposals that
          both parties can agree, the mediators incorporate them into a
          settlement agreement and they get both parties to sign it on that day.
          The agreement becomes legally binding once all parties have signed it.
          You will receive a copy of the agreement as soon as all outstanding
          fees have been paid.
