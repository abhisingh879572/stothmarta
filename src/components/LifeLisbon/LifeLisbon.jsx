            <b> Coaching</b> is a creative partnership with your client,

            people from all walks of life, including executives, business
            owners, sales people and anyone else with the desire to reach for
            their goals and unlock their true potential.

                      “Some weeks ago I attended a life coaching course at Lineo
                      International Consulting. The course was held locally in
                      Malta. Throughout the course I had the opportunity to
                      learn the various aspects of life coaching while at the
                      same see practical examples of how coaching is performed.
                      The approach used was very welcoming and at the same time
                      quite intense, making the experience very positive.
                      Through the different activities delivered during the
                      session and the assignments I worked on following the
                      session, the tutor ensured commitment and learning. At the
                      end of the course I felt that I have acquired a very good
                      grasp of the life coaching process and how this can help
                      me in my day to day work. Marti, the course tutor, is very
                      knowledgeable in the areas and has a wealth of experience
                      to share during the sessions. The insights provided during
                      the course gives added value and makes it possible to link
                      the theoretical part with the practicality of the course
                      content. In addition, she is always ready to reply to
                      queries and flexible in adapting the content to the
                      student’s requirements.” David

                  Emotional intelligence means being smart with feelings, and
                  it’s an essential capacity for effective coaching. EQ helps
                  coaches see, <br /> understand, and support their clients in a
                  more powerful relationship — and EQ equips clients to get to
                  the <br />
                  heart of performance. And you can use EQ at your workplace, at
                  home, schools or in your private live. You will see the
                  difference <br />
                  EQ makes in quality of life, wellbeing, effectiveness and
                  relationships. During our course you will have the chance to
                  learn how EQ will help you to become a better coach.
