          Even top business leaders have their blindspots. It’s a part of being
          human, but inconvenient or even plain risky for those with a lot of
          responsibility. The mounting pressure on today’s executives threatens
          to suffocate organizational development as CEOs and the executive team
          tackle greater accountability, visibility and constant technological
          and sociological developments. Executive-level leaders face unique
          challenges; they confront a myriad of issues, uncertainties, and
          demands every single day. The decisions and actions of these leaders
          affect shareholders, customers, and employees, so they must work hard
          to satisfy competing demands—a difficult task even under the best of
          circumstances. With everything there is for senior-level leaders to do
          and consider, the need to help them maximize their leadership
          effectiveness is more critical than ever. No matter how talented,
          experienced, or knowledgeable these leaders may be, the nature of
          their work requires that they continue to develop their leadership
          skills so they can perform at peak level

              Family Law Mediation is a type of dispute resolution based on the
              cooperation and maintenance of a friendly relationship between
              separating or divorcing partners. This method consists of a
              neutral third party who is present during meetings, and assists
              the parties in coming to an agreement of all issues pertaining to
              the dissolution of their relationship.

            Emotionally intelligent leaders can identify these feelings and use
            them as a powerful tool to enhance working relationships. Research
            proves EI (emotional intelligence) is more relevant than IQ
            (intellectual quotient) and technical skills combined. Executive
            Coaching in this area helps you recognize

            > Identifying emotions as they arise, and becoming aware of how they
            govern our interactions <br />
            > Discovering how our unfiltered reactions appear to others <br />
            > Gaining a heightened attentiveness to and command over social
            situations
            <br />
            > How to manage yourself before managing others
            <br />
          </p>
          <p>
            Increasing emotional intelligence improves relationships and the
            navigation of complex social situations.

                Contact me as soon as you need help sorting things out. Even if
                you’ve been separated for a while, or if your case has already
                gone to court, mediation can still help to resolve things. You
                can’t usually take your case to court until you find out if
                mediation can help you first. If you can’t show that you’ve
                considered it, the judge may stop or delay proceedings until you
                have.
