          <br />
          <p>
            Current thinking in Psychology generally agrees that we all have a
            Conscious Mind and an Unconscious Mind. Making a change in our
            attitudes, beliefs and values is not easy for most people to do,
            because they approach the change consciously. But for a change to
            happen it needs a two-pronged approach to the Conscious Mind and the
            Unconscious Mind. Hypnosis facilitates that by making the
            Unconscious Mind more amenable to suggestion from the Hypnotist or
            even by you.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            The Unconscious Mind is the part of you that runs your body. It
            allows you to breathe you while you sleep. It makes your heart beat.
            It causes your nerves to send information along the neural pathways.
            The Unconscious Mind is the source of the intelligence of your body
            and Hypnosis and Hypnotherapy allow you to tap into the power of the
            Unconscious Mind to change your life for the better.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            Everything that you have ever experienced in your life has been
            stored in your mind. The subconscious mind works like a computer and
            becomes programmed, usually through repetition. When you change your
            subconscious mind, you change your behavior automatically.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            The human mind can pick out and learn from information that is not
            consciously observed. Hypnosis and NLP both influence the
            subconscious mind. In many ways, hypnosis and NLP are opposite sides
            of the same coin and when they are combined they become arguably the
            most powerful tool for human evolution that has ever been developed.
            With Hypnosis and NLP one can talk and give suggestions directly to
            the unconscious mind. Here, empowering suggestions are readily
            accepted and acted upon expanding your energy, skills and resources,
            and enabling changes to occur. The hypnotic state is one of
            increased awareness. Once we are in a hypnotic state, we can
            interact with our unconscious mind, which is the center of our
            feelings.

                Hypnosis is a state of focused attention resulting in a
                heightened ability to accept suggestions. Hypnosis is a
                scientifically verified technique that can promote accelerated
                human change. Hypnosis is both a natural state of mind and a
                process. Hypnosis is a deep, relaxed, focused state of
                concentration. Hypnosis is a completely safe and natural state
                of mind, matter of fact, you may have been in a state of
                hypnosis many times today. Hypnosis is a state of deep physical
                and mental relaxation that allows direct communication with the
                subconscious. Hypnosis is not sleep; in fact, you are relaxed
                but focused and alert. Hypnosis is a process in which critical
                thinking faculties of the mind are bypassed (asked to go into
                deep relaxation, a sleep state of the muscles so to speak) and a
                type of selective thinking and perception is established.
                Hypnosis is the science of influencing the subconscious mind to
                change the thought pattern and behavior in individuals.

            is a multi-dimensional process that involves the development of
            behavioral competence and flexibility, but also involves strategic
            thinking and an understanding of the mental and cognitive processes
            behind behavior.

            empowering beliefs and presuppositions about what human beings are,
            what communication is and what the process of change is all about.
            At another level, NLP is about self-discovery, exploring identity
            and mission. It also provides a framework for understanding and
            relating to the ‘spiritual’ part of human experience that reaches
            beyond us as individuals to our family, community and global
            systems.

            Simply because it’s proven to work. If you want to have more choices
            about your behavior and emotion, to improve your relationships and
            the way you communicate, and create better results through becoming
            a greater thinker, then NLP can provide you with a step-by-step
            framework for achieving all this and more. Not just in the short
            term, but lasting transformation, which will stay with you for your
            entire life. The thousands that have learned the secrets of NLP have
            been so successful because they have applied NLP to their daily
            lives. It’s the same technology Oprah Winfrey, Tiger Woods, Anthony
            Robbins and Bill Gates (and hundreds of thousands of others) use to
            achieve consistent results most of us can only dream of.

          How useful would it be to have a manual for the brain? A users guide?
          According to William James one of the founders of American Psychology,
          the average person uses only 10% of their brains full potential. NLP
          allows you to better understand your mind and enables you to access
          the excellence you already inherently have NLP will allow you to
          create new neurological pathways, this will create behaviors that
          better serve you for your life and eliminate old destructive patterns
          of behavior. In a nut shell, NLP can help anything that you do in life
          that requires thought, either conscious or unconscious.

            Think about this… was a moment in your life when you decided you
            would change a dysfunctional behavior and do something different
            only to find you unconsciously repeated the same old habit? Unwanted
            behaviours and beliefs have been learned and stored at an
            unconscious level, and these may no longer serve you. For example,
            as a child you may have ‘learnt’ to become afraid of spiders, this
            may have been because the first time you saw a spider the adults in
            the room showed you how to ‘behave’ by running away from the spider.
            This is then stored at an unconscious level and every time you now
            see a spider you react automatically in the same way. It becomes an
            automatic unconscious response which you are unable to change
            consciously, this is the same for phobias and fears and they can
            only be changed at the unconscious level. This is also true of
            limiting beliefs, you may be letting a belief that you formed at a
            young uniformed age hold you back today, like ‘I am not worthy’.
            This is only a belief, it is not true and therefore can be changed
            at an unconscious level to a belief that will empower you life.
            Often people do not consciously know what and especially how they do
            something. This is where NLP is important. It helps you see and
            understand how you can change the responses and behaviors that don’t
            work for you to the ones that allow you to life your life to the
            full.
