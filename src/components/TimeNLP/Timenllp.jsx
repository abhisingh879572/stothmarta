            Time Line Therapy™ is a collection of techniques that allow you to
            gain emotional control over your life. Inappropriate emotional
            reactions, such as bursts of anger, periods of apathy, depression,
            sadness, anxiety, and chronic fear, are responsible for preventing
            people from achieving the quality of life they desire. Limiting
            decisions, such as “I’m not good enough,” “I’ll never be rich,” or
            “I don’t deserve a great marriage,” create false limitations and
            hamper your ability to create reachable and attainable goals and
            outcomes. Created by Dr. Tad James, Time Line Therapy techniques
            enable you to eliminate many types of issues in your past, thus
            allowing you to move forward toward your goals and desires.

              Applications of NLP and Time Line Therapy in Business

            While many people take NLP and Time Line Therapy Sessions for their
            own personal growth and development, they are also of the utmost
            value to the professional. Some professions using NLP include
            Salespeople, Business Executives, Managers, Business Owners,
            Lawyers, Teachers, Trainers, Counselors, Educators, Doctors,
            Chiropractors, Massage Therapists, Consultants, Hypnotherapists,
            Psychologists, Athletes, Entertainers and Performers. Regardless of
            profession, the majority of NLP clients are searching, and finding,
            better and more effective ways to increase their performance and
            improve their effectiveness. Whether you’re already succeeding in
            your profession, having some difficulties, or if you’re
            transitioning into a new position, NLP and Time Line Therapy™
            techniques can help you achieve, maintain and enhance excellence.
            Managers and Entrepreneurs use the information to develop strong
            teamwork and relationships, and to foster positive interpersonal
            skills. Negotiations and problem solving sessions are enhanced to
            create solution-oriented, win-win approaches. Salespeople learn to
            build deep levels of rapport, elicit and fulfill the criteria and
            values of clients, and develop effective methods for handling
            buyer’s remorse or future objections so the sales relationship is
            long-term and mutually satisfying. Trainers and Educators learn new
            paradigms for inspiring and engaging students, as well as effective
            techniques for dealing with challenging learning environments.
            Mental Health Professionals learn new skills and techniques that
            supplement their repertoire, and gain additional insights into
            helping clients make the changes that support their own process of
            healing. Medical Professionals learn techniques to better elicit
            information from clients, and to help the client be more comfortable
            with and receptive to treatment, thus supporting them to heal in a
            more responsive way.
