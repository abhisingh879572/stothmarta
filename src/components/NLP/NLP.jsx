            . The neurological system regulates how our bodies function,
            language determines how we interface and communicate with other
            people and our programming determines the kinds of models of the
            world we create. Neuro-Linguistic Programming describes the
            fundamental dynamics between mind (neuro) and language (linguistic)
            and how their interplay affects our body and behavior (programming).

            is a multi-dimensional process that involves the development of
            behavioral competence and flexibility, but also involves strategic
            thinking and an understanding of the mental and cognitive processes
            behind behavior.

            provides tools and skills for the development of states of

            empowering beliefs and presuppositions about what human beings are,
            what communication is and what the process of change is all about.
            At another level, NLP is about self-discovery, exploring identity
            and mission. It also provides a framework for understanding and
            relating to the ‘spiritual’ part of human experience that reaches
            beyond us as individuals to our family, community and global
            systems.

            Simply because it’s proven to work. If you want to have more choices
            about your behavior and emotion, to improve your relationships and
            the way you communicate, and create better results through becoming
            a greater thinker, then NLP can provide you with a step-by-step
            framework for achieving all this and more. Not just in the short
            term, but lasting transformation, which will stay with you for your
            entire life. The thousands that have learned the secrets of NLP have
            been so successful because they have applied NLP to their daily
            lives. It’s the same technology Oprah Winfrey, Tiger Woods, Anthony
            Robbins and Bill Gates (and hundreds of thousands of others) use to
            achieve consistent results most of us can only dream of.

          How useful would it be to have a manual for the brain? A users guide?
          According to William James one of the founders of American Psychology,
          the average person uses only 10% of their brains full potential. NLP
          allows you to better understand your mind and enables you to access
          the excellence you already inherently have NLP will allow you to
          create new neurological pathways, this will create behaviors that
          better serve you for your life and eliminate old destructive patterns
          of behavior. In a nut shell, NLP can help anything that you do in life
          that requires thought, either conscious or unconscious.

            Think about this… was a moment in your life when you decided you
            would change a dysfunctional behavior and do something different
            only to find you unconsciously repeated the same old habit? Unwanted
            behaviours and beliefs have been learned and stored at an
            unconscious level, and these may no longer serve you. For example,
            as a child you may have ‘learnt’ to become afraid of spiders, this
            may have been because the first time you saw a spider the adults in
            the room showed you how to ‘behave’ by running away from the spider.
            This is then stored at an unconscious level and every time you now
            see a spider you react automatically in the same way. It becomes an
            automatic unconscious response which you are unable to change
            consciously, this is the same for phobias and fears and they can
            only be changed at the unconscious level. This is also true of
            limiting beliefs, you may be letting a belief that you formed at a
            young uniformed age hold you back today, like ‘I am not worthy’.
            This is only a belief, it is not true and therefore can be changed
            at an unconscious level to a belief that will empower you life.
            Often people do not consciously know what and especially how they do
            something. This is where NLP is important. It helps you see and
            understand how you can change the responses and behaviors that don’t
            work for you to the ones that allow you to life your life to the
            full.
