            What Is Life Coaching?
          </b>
          <br />
          <h5 className="mt-3">
            <b> Coaching</b> is a creative partnership with your client,
            focusing on designing and implementing specific, meaningful changes
            in your client’s personal and/or professional life. Coaches assist
            people from all walks of life, including executives, business
            owners, sales people and anyone else with the desire to reach for
            their goals and unlock their true potential.
          </h5>
          <h5 className="mt-3">
            A <b> Coach </b> is a client’s ultimate ally. They are singularly
            focused on working with their client to establish better goals,
            inspire them to achieve more, empower them with the practical and
            philosophical tools to do so, motivate them to sustain focus and
            steer them towards success.
          </h5>
          <p>
            <b> Coaches assist clients</b> to build a bridge between where the
            client is now and where would like to be. Clients’ goals can vary a
            great deal from personal goals such as obtaining a greater level of
            personal fulfilment; through professional goals such as achieving
            certain business benchmarks; and sporting goals such as attaining a
            level of competence and achievement; to family goals which may
            include creating a more stress-free family life. A professionally
            trained Coach can empower their clients to attain all this and more
            in their lives.

            How To Benefit From Life Coaching In Other Jobs?
          </h5>
          <p className="mt-5">
            One does not have to work as a professional Coach to benefit from
            what you learn and aquire during Life Coaching Courses. Unless you
            have such definite intentions, you do not have to change your career
            path or profession to see the beauty and advantages of coaching
            methods and tools. Through the successful incorporation and
            transition of your new and deep knowledge of coaching skills into
            your current job, you can experience better fulfillment, more
            inspiring aims to reach and work for, more satisfactory
            relationships with your clients, bosses or colleagues, more
            effective communication – even be a journalist, lawyer, HR
            specialist, teacher or sportsman.

                      “Some weeks ago I attended a life coaching course at Lineo
                      International Consulting. The course was held locally in
                      Malta. Throughout the course I had the opportunity to
                      learn the various aspects of life coaching while at the
                      same see practical examples of how coaching is performed.
                      The approach used was very welcoming and at the same time
                      quite intense, making the experience very positive.
                      Through the different activities delivered during the
                      session and the assignments I worked on following the
                      session, the tutor ensured commitment and learning. At the
                      end of the course I felt that I have acquired a very good
                      grasp of the life coaching process and how this can help
                      me in my day to day work. Marti, the course tutor, is very
                      knowledgeable in the areas and has a wealth of experience
                      to share during the sessions. The insights provided during
                      the course gives added value and makes it possible to link
                      the theoretical part with the practicality of the course
                      content. In addition, she is always ready to reply to
                      queries and flexible in adapting the content to the
                      student’s requirements.” David

                  How can emotional intelligence accelerate change in coaching?{" "}
                  <br />
                  Emotional intelligence means being smart with feelings, and
                  it’s an essential capacity for effective coaching. EQ helps
                  coaches see, <br /> understand, and support their clients in a
                  more powerful relationship — and EQ equips clients to get to
                  the <br />
                  heart of performance. And you can use EQ at your workplace, at
                  home, schools or in your private live. You will see the
                  difference <br />
                  EQ makes in quality of life, wellbeing, effectiveness and
                  relationships. During our course you will have the chance to
                  learn how EQ will help you to become a better coach.
