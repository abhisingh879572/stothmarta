              2 Key principles of processing
            </b>{" "}
            <br />
            S. TÓTH MÁRTA pays special attention to protecting the personal data
            of persons it comes into contact with, its accuracy and confidential
            nature, acts in a preventative manner to process the data solely on
            valid legal grounds compatible with purpose limitation and storage
            limitation, refrains from disclosing the personal data it processes
            to any third party or organisation in the absence of legal grounds
            and erasing the data after the legal grounds of processing no longer
            apply. In light of its above objectives, S. TÓTH MÁRTA shall make
            every effort to fully comply with the following key principles of
            personal data processing during the course of the processing of
            personal data without any restriction and in every case:

            At the same time, many organizations realize that the{" "}
            <b className="text-teal-600">Leadership Coaching</b> model of
            leading and influencing is no longer optimal to succeed in today’s
            complex and dynamic marketplace. To adopt more relational,
            collaborative, and consultative models for leading and influencing,
            businesses are evolving to build coaching cultures that encourage
            organizational learning and adaptability. And leadership coaching
            has emerged as the best way to help individuals learn to think and
            work together more effectively.
            <br />
            <br />
            The ability to coach leaders is a core competency for those helping
            organizations to develop. Through coaching, leaders learn how to
            optimize the value of teams and organizations.{" "}
            <b className="text-teal-600">Leadership Coaching</b> helps clarify
            vision, beliefs, and values, and stretches the capacity to lead and
            influence. Leaders then become catalysts for change within their
            organizations.

            S. TÓTH MÁRTA reserves the right to unilaterally amend the present
            Policy without the explicit consent of data owners. In light of
            this, S. TÓTH MÁRTA agrees to always publish the valid version of
            the Policy and concurrently ensures access to the previous versions
            of the Policy on the website http://coaching-nlp.hu/ for data owners
            to always have accurate information in connection with the
            processing activity undertaken by S. TÓTH MÁRTA and rules regulating
            this activity. By providing personal data to S. TÓTH MÁRTA, in
            particular, in light of Section 3(2) of the Freedom of Information
            Act, the data owner declares to have gained knowledge of the version
            of the present Policy valid at the time the data was provided and
            explicitly accepts its provisions.

            <b style={{ color: "#006f82" }}>Leadership Coaching </b> ties
            coaching outcomes to organizational strategy. Coaching is often
            tactical in orientation. Leaders tend to develop generic
            capabilities identified as “gaps” separate from the leader’s unique
            context. A next generation approach to Leadership Coaching, by
            contrast, integrates coaching with organizational context and
            strategy. Leaders develop broad capabilities relevant to realizing
            the organization’s strategic objectives now and in the future.

            <b>Third,</b>{" "}
            <b style={{ color: "#006f82" }}>Leadership Coaching </b> supports
            the development of an organization-wide coaching culture. Addressing
            the broader context in which the leader operates, it takes into full
            account the role of managers, colleagues, business strategy, culture
            and processes. Using the insight, tools and experience of seasoned
            management consultants, it works with the organization to create an
            environment conducive to the success of the newly coached leader and
            of the coaching of other leaders.

          <h5 className="mt-4">
            If you are looking to outpace your competition with leaders who are
            skilled strategists and excellent communicators, then look carefully
            to see if Leadership Coaching will give your organization that
            winning edge.
