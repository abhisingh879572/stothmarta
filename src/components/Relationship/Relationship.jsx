            What is Mediation (Conflict Resolution) <br />
          </b>{" "}
          Mediation for Families and Relationships is a process where a neutral
          third party with no decision making power – the mediator – helps
          people to negotiate a settlement to their dispute. One of the most
          important differences between mediation and the court process (which
          is called litigation) is that mediation allows people to reach
          agreements that meet everyone’s interests.

              Family Law Mediation is a type of dispute resolution based on the
              cooperation and maintenance of a friendly relationship between
              separating or divorcing partners. This method consists of a
              neutral third party who is present during meetings, and assists
              the parties in coming to an agreement of all issues pertaining to
              the dissolution of their relationship.

              This form of dispute resolution is client based, in that the
              parties control the entire process with only the help of a neutral
              third party. The spouses will be required to co-operate with and
              listen to each other, while regarding the other’s opinions and
              needs. If the parties are having difficulties coming to a final
              decision of an issue, or are having disagreements, the mediator
              cannot impose a settlement. The mediator does not act as a lawyer,
              as well as they do not advise the parties of their legal rights or
              obligations. The mediator simply acts as a guide within the
              proceedings, attempting to maintain the communication and
              consideration of the important issues between the parties. It is
              strongly advised that the parties consult with lawyers prior to
              participating in mediation, as the process can only be fully
              secured if it is informed, as well as having lawyers present helps
              to protect the rights and interests of each party, which may
              result in a more efficient resolution of the issues. Mediation
              ensures that all decisions made within the proceedings are made in
              the best interest of all parties, ensuring a fair and peaceful
              resolution.

            are endless and that is why more and more people are paying for
            these services out of pocket, if it is not provided in the
            workplace. People no longer want to feel stagnant in their roles or
            be disgusted with the work they do or people they do it with. They
            want to find a career that will make use of all of their talents and
            not just a sliver of their talents. People are not trained to be
            masters of career transition. They were taught to pick a major in
            college and then take the first job that fits their requirements.
            People are not the only ones who benefit in a positive manner. The
            benefits of developing your organization with the help of a coach

              Family mediators are there to help you to reach decisions about
              things that are important for you and your family. They can help
              you to find a way to plan for the future and to agree what will
              work best for you without having to go to court. That can save you
              time, money and stress. Mediation provides you with the space and
              time to think about what is most important for your children and
              for the whole family. You can work out how arrangements for your
              children will work best and think about what is going to be
              important for your children as they grow up

                Contact me as soon as you need help sorting things out. Even if
                you’ve been separated for a while, or if your case has already
                gone to court, mediation can still help to resolve things. You
                can’t usually take your case to court until you find out if
                mediation can help you first. If you can’t show that you’ve
                considered it, the judge may stop or delay proceedings until you
                have.

            Think about this… was a moment in your life when you decided you
            would change a dysfunctional behavior and do something different
            only to find you unconsciously repeated the same old habit? Unwanted
            behaviours and beliefs have been learned and stored at an
            unconscious level, and these may no longer serve you. For example,
            as a child you may have ‘learnt’ to become afraid of spiders, this
            may have been because the first time you saw a spider the adults in
            the room showed you how to ‘behave’ by running away from the spider.
            This is then stored at an unconscious level and every time you now
            see a spider you react automatically in the same way. It becomes an
            automatic unconscious response which you are unable to change
            consciously, this is the same for phobias and fears and they can
            only be changed at the unconscious level. This is also true of
            limiting beliefs, you may be letting a belief that you formed at a
            young uniformed age hold you back today, like ‘I am not worthy’.
            This is only a belief, it is not true and therefore can be changed
            at an unconscious level to a belief that will empower you life.
            Often people do not consciously know what and especially how they do
            something. This is where NLP is important. It helps you see and
            understand how you can change the responses and behaviors that don’t
            work for you to the ones that allow you to life your life to the
            full.
